RECENT_USAGE_CAPTION="""This plot shows battery capacity remaining over time.
The upward trend in the graph indicates that the battery is being charged while the downward trend indicates that the battery is being used, and the flat portions indicates that the battery is not being used or charged."""

DURATION_CAPTION="""This plot shows duration versus frequency of active sessions in the last 36 hours."""

DISTRIBUTION_CAPTION="""This plot shows the distribution of active sessions in the last 36 hours.
The distribution is shown as a histogram, with the x-axis representing the hour of the day and the y-axis representing the frequency of active sessions."""

CAPACITY_LOSS_CAPTION="""
As time passes, the battery's ability to hold a charge gradually decreases.
This plot shows how much charge your battery can hold over time, compared to its original design capacity when it was new.
The percentage indicates the current charge capacity of your battery in relation to its initial capacity.
A decrease in this value means your battery is losing its ability to hold a full charge, which is a natural process for most batteries."""

LIFE_LOSS_CAPTION="""
Over time, your battery's performance can decrease, which means it may not last as long on a single charge. 
This plot shows how much battery backup (in minutes) has been lost over time. 
The trend line helps visualize if the loss is getting worse or if it's staying the same. 
A consistent increase in battery backup loss suggests that your battery's overall life is gradually reducing, 
which is normal as batteries age.
